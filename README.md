# Recommendation-System
This project is a content-based movie recommendation system that suggests similar movies based on plot summaries. Using datasets from The Movie Database (TMDb), the model leverages TF-IDF vectorization and a sigmoid kernel to calculate movie similarities based on the movie's overview.
